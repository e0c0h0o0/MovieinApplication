# CS 501 Final Project - JustMoveIn
> **Team**:   Jiayin Fan,Haixi Zhang<br>

*Whether we go to school or work in a new city, we need to solve the problem of renting a house
and purchasing furniture facilities. So we designed JustMovein, which is an app that combines rental housing and
second-hand purchase for both buying and selling. Make it easy for users to move in.*

## Application Features

### 1. House Subletting/Renting
Users can list houses for subletting or renting, making it easier to find accommodations or temporary residences. Each listing allows users to provide detailed descriptions, set prices, and upload multiple images to showcase the property effectively. Users can search for houses based on different categories such as studio, 1-bed, or 2-beds.

### 2. Item Trading
The item trading feature enables users to buy, sell, or trade items within a community-driven marketplace. Users can post item listings with descriptions, categorize items, set prices, and upload images. The platform supports searching and filtering items by categories, making it easy for users to find what they're looking for.

### 3. User Account Management
Our application supports comprehensive user account management features. Users can create and edit their profiles, manage their listings (both items and houses), and interact with other users through the platform. This includes changing account details, resetting passwords, and reviewing personal activity history.
